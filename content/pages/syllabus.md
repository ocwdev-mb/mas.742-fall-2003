Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

A Cognitive Science Approach To Engineering
-------------------------------------------

The look, feel and use of objects communicate their value to us. This course applies cognitive science and technology to the industrial design process. The course will introduce prototyping techniques and approaches for objective evaluation as part of the design process. Students will practice evaluating products with mechanical and electronic aspects. The evaluation process will then be applied to creating functioning product prototypes. This is a project-oriented course that will draw on engineering, aesthetic, and creative skills. The course is geared towards students interested in creating physical products which encompass electronics and computers in order to include them in scenarios. Students will present readings, learn prototyping skills, create a product prototype, and complete a publication style paper. We will mill, cut, mold solder, program, and draw our way to evaluating product design.

Model making and prototyping skills will be taught.
